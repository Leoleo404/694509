                <h2>Future for smartwathces</h2>
                <p>when wearables first hit the market back in 2010 they were pretty simple devices, largely aimed
                    at tracking workouts for athletes and fitness geeks. For tech companies, the appeal is clear:
                    while only a few million people might have a smartwatch right now, billions of people visit a
                    medical professional every year.
                    As the wearable tech industry has developed, companies are starting to look for their next phase
                    of growth. And there's only so much they can do in the limited market of fitness. That's where
                    they realise that healthcare is the next big thing, because healthcare is undergoing a
                    transition </p>

                <h2>Expectations</h2>
                <p>A smartwatch sends vibrations to your wrist to indicate whether you should turn right or left
                    when following directions.
                    Instead of constantly looking at your smartphone, you can follow an invisible guide that tells
                    you where to go.
                    Instead of looking at a map, look around and take in the scenery.
                    While running, cycling, swimming, or doing any other type of exercise, you may want to check
                    your messages, calls, or notifications.
                    Keeping your phone with you during those activities isn't always practical, and when you do, it
                    can be awkward and annoying.
                    This is where a smartwatch can help.</p>

                <h2>About the Google Pixel Watch</h2>
                <p>After months of speculation, leaks, and a sneak peek in May, Google finally revealed its first
                    smart watch in October 2022. Google's Pixel Watch is modern, compact, and loaded with
                    cutting-edge software.
                    The Google Pixel Watch now has a distinct appearance. The manufacturer chose a 1.2-inch circular
                    amoled screen with true black. The case measures 41 millimetres in diameter, and the screen
                    edges are quite thick in comparison to other smartwatches. Google was also able to add an
                    always-on function using amoled techniques. You can see the time and important information
                    without having to turn on the wearable.</p>
