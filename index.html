            <h2>Garmin Forerunner 55</h2>
            <h5><strong>$200</strong></h5>
            <p>This watch is aimed at people who don't need all of the fancier features of a higher-end
                Forerunner 245, 745, or 945 series - but still want the core run tracking functionality. Of
                course, with each successive series, these so-called basic running watches gain more and more
                features, eventually making them far more feature-capable than the previous iteration of
                mid-range watches.
                The majority of the features that were added to the FR245 last time around have been added to
                the Forerunner 55, including running track mode, daily suggested workouts, women's health
                tracking, PacePro, Recovery Time and plenty more.
            </p>

            <h2>Apple watch 8</h2>
            <h5><em>$500</em></h5>
            <p>At its Far Out event, Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Series 8. It's now the middle child of the
                Apple Watch lineup, following the all-new Apple Watch Ultra. However, this does not imply that
                it has been forgotten. With some noteworthy new features and the potential for significantly
                increased battery life, the Apple Watch Series 8 appears to be a worthy successor to last year's
                Series 7. The rumors are true; Apple has included a temperature sensor in the Apple Watch Series
                8. The sensor is sensitive enough to sense a 0.1 degree Celsius temperature change in your body.

            <h2>Fitbit Versa 4</h2>
            <h5><strong>$230</strong></h5>
            <p>Fitbit appears to be distinguishing itself from other wearables on the market by emphasising
                sports even more.
                You can still read messages from your smartphone on the screen, but you can't control music or
                install third-party apps with the latest generation of wearables.
                The most notable advancement is a physical button on the side of the watch.
                The Versa 3 had a button just below the watch's curvature that you had to cover with your thumb.
                This did not work out well.
                The Versa 4 now has a very pleasant button to press. </p>
